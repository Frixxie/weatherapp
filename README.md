# weatherapp prototype

This is a weather app that shows the current temperature, weather, map, and graph of the temperature the last three and a halv days.

I wrote using self collected weather data from the scripts folder and the javascript library P5.

To run this it is needed a simple http server enviorment, for example nodejs's http-server or python's SimpleHTTPServer module. 

This will be project will be continued.
